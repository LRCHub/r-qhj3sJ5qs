[00:44.17] The morning of machine civilization
[00:47.95] 赤い楯 影迷い
[00:51.59] 灰色の服纏い
[00:55.23] リズムに囚われた朝
[00:58.47] いつもと同じ瞬間
[01:01.76] 止めない生産ライン
[01:06.25] 何かが欠けてる
[01:10.03] In the twilight of machinery
[01:24.03] 
[01:13.95] Where's the world going
[01:16.95] Won't somebody tell me
[01:21.00] Are these thoughts illusion
[01:24.76] Are we all one
[01:28.57] この世界は変われるのか
[01:34.81] この想いは幻か
[01:38.31] 
[01:58.58] People find work to be done
[02:01.85] 人は働き 鳥歌う
[02:05.61] 眠りに落ちた夢
[02:09.33] 目を覚ませ 彼叫ぶ
[02:12.21] いつもと同じ瞬間
[02:15.87] この刹那に生きる
[02:20.19] いつか革命求め
[02:24.29] In the twilight of machinery
[02:38.29] 
[02:28.09] Where's the world going
[02:31.63] Won't somebody tell me
[02:34.93] Are these thoughts illusion
[02:38.58] Are we all one
[02:42.25] この想いを変えれるのか
[02:48.44] いつも夢に笑いかける
[02:53.44] 
[03:12.30] Are these thoughts illusion
[03:25.80] 
[04:10.99] Where's the world going
[04:15.02] Won't somebody tell me
[04:18.28] Are these thoughts illusion
[04:21.95] Are we all one
[04:25.62] この想いを変えれるのか
[04:32.11] いつも夢に笑いかける

[05:21.15] Revolution
[05:21.64] Desire
[05:22.11] Science
